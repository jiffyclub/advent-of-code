    "The navigation system's license file consists of a list of numbers (your puzzle input). The numbers define a data structure which, when processed, produces some kind of tree that can be used to calculate the license number.\n",

    "The tree is made up of nodes; a single, outermost node forms the tree's root, and it contains all other nodes in the tree (or contains nodes that contain nodes, and so on).\n",

    "A header, which is always exactly two numbers:\n",

A metadata entry of `1` refers to the first child node, `2` to the second, `3` to the third, and so on. The value of this node is the sum of the values of the child nodes referenced by the metadata entries. If a referenced child node does not exist, that reference is skipped. A child node can be referenced multiple time and counts each time it is referenced. A metadata entry of `0` does not refer to any child node.\n",
